Explaining research ideas clearly was perhaps my most difficult undertaking
while pursuing a [PhD]({% post_url 2021-09-30-phd-thesis %}). More often than
not, my explanations were frankly incomprehenible and that is entirely my own
fault. But sometimes my audience had inaccurate ideas and misplaced
expectations about the subject matter. I found real-time systems to be one of
those misunderstood topics. In the remaining of this post, I will attempt to
clear up some of the confusion and explain what real-time systems are.

**NOTE:** This is the first post of a two-part series about real-time systems.
The following post will mostly talk about hard real-time analysis.

## What are Real-Time Systems?

Every applications imposes a set of constrains that computer engineers are
constantly battling to meet. Of course, a constraint is (almost!) always that
the program should produce the correct result. But it is also common to want a
system to perform a task as fast as possible, these are run-time constraints,
or to ensure that a device's battery life lasts longer, as in a constraint on
power consumption. A real-time system is simply a system that has *timing*
constraints in addition to correctness and (potentially) run-time or power
requirements. In a real-time system, the time when a result is produced (i.e.
before a deadline) is as important as ensuring that the result is correct.

Lets consider a couple of use-cases. Classic examples of real-time applications
are [safety-critical
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety-critical_system) such as [cardiac
pacemakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker), engine
control systems and avionics. Clearly, these systems must always operate
correctly *and* deliver results on time (i.e. before a deadline) otherwise
patients may die, your car engine might explote or a plane could crash.
Interactive systems are also good examples of real-time systems, although not
quite as critical, such as mobile phones or desktop PCs. For example, we like
responsive PCs that keep the mouse pointer moving smoothly, windows
switching quickly and videos or music playing clearly. These are all real-time
tasks and the deadline usually is "before the user gets annoyed".  Unresponsive
PCs make unhappy and frustrated users, and I have been known to angrily strike
the keyboard once or twice when this happens!

**NOTE:** A coincidentally pedantic note on the use of the words *run-time* and
*runtime*. Lots of people (myself included!) often use these words
interchangeable, but I was very fortunate to have been corrected by someone
peer reviewing my journal submission. So nowadays I use the word
*run-time* to mean the length of time that something takes to run. I also refer
to a program's status of being running as *run-time*, e.g. as in variables are
resolved at run-time. In contrast, I use *runtime* to mean the environment in
which a program is running, e.g. as in a runtime library. These definitions are
by no means perfect, but I strive to be consistent!

## Real-Time Systems are NOT...

Fast, power-efficient, secure, small, etc. Or rather, real-time systems are not
*necessarily* fast, power-efficient, secure, small, etc. These are individual
constraints that a system could be required to meet, but neither of them implies
the other. Many people are particularly puzzled to hear that a fast system,
i.e. the run-time of a task is very short, does not mean that it is real-time.
In fact, real-time are systems often slower than their non-real-time
counterparts due to the overheads inherent to concurrent operation, such as
[context switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch),
[synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science)),
etc.

[Garbage
collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))
is an example that neatly illustrates this real-time and run-time performance
tradeoff. The collector is a component of the runtime environment responsible
for automatically reclaiming unused memory and repurposing it to fulfil future
dynamic memory allocation requests. Its work is critical to both the
real-time and run-time performance of many programming languages like Python,
JavaScript, Java, etc.

<em>Stop-the-world garbage collectors. Each bar represents the execution in a single core.
White regions are the execution of the user's program threads and shaded regions
correspond to the collector's execution.</em>
</p>

The simplest and fastest collectors are *stop-the-world*: the user's program is
stopped while the collector does its job and then the program is restarted as
shown above. The run-time performance of these collectors is great because
there is little interaction with the user's program. In fact, it is
straight-forward to run these collectors in a single-core or in parallel across
multiple cores to reclaim memory faster. But the real-time performance of the
system is atrocious either way because the user's program is stopped (i.e.
paused, does not run) while the collector runs, so any task that the program is
supposed to do is delayed. *Concurrent* collectors mitigate this real-time
problem by either running collection operations interleaved or in parallel with
the program as shown below.

<em>Concurrent garbage collectors.</em>
</p>

However, concurrent collectors require a lot of synchronization to make sure
the system works properly. Sadly, the extra synchronization often incurs high
run-time overheads although this is unavoidable for the system to operate in
real-time.

You can clearly see this tradeoff for yourself in [this
presentation](https://youtu.be/Scxz6jVS4Ls) about the JavaScript V8 Engine
which is used in Chrome. Ideally, the web browser runs at 60 fps to avoid jank,
so each frame must be generated in about 16 ms. But using a stop-the-world
garbage collector caused earlier Chrome versions to often miss these deadlines.
More recent Chrome versions use a mostly concurrent collector. The video below
compares the very visible effects of both collectors.

## Types of Real-Time Systems

You might have noticed that not all real-time systems are the same. It is
important to consider the kind and strictness of timing requirements when
engineering such systems. So it is common to clasify real-time systems as:

* **Soft Real-Time:** There are many systems, like phones, tablets, etc, where
it is desirable to meet deadlines, but there is no harm if deadlines are missed
occasionally. For example, we said that ideally Chrome runs at 60 fps although
nobody will die if sometimes it does 55, 58, 56 fps! In other words,
it is desirable for the real-time system to meet all its deadlines, but in
practice, its acceptable if some deadlines are missed because the worst
consequece is perhaps an annoyed user.
* **Hard Real-Time:** The system must *always* meet deadlines if hard real-time
operation is required. Failure to meet a deadline is equivalent to an incorrect
calculation and can result in catastrophic consequences such as the death of
a patient or an airplane crashing. Cardiac pacemakers and avionics are good
examples of hard real-time systems.

Naturally, the approach for engineering and testing soft real-time systems is a
lot more informal. The system is developed and empirical experiments are run in
various settings to ensure that most deadlines are met i.e. that the frequency
of missed deadlines is below a threshold. I have even heard of engineers
testing soft real-time systems with slow processors and then switching to
faster ones (or cranking up the clock!) just to make extra sure that the final
product does meet *most* deadlines. In contrast, there are formal static
analysis methods to evaluate hard real-time systems and guarantee that no
deadlines are missed under *any* circumstance. I will describe one such method
in the next blog post.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, real-time systems are simply systems that have timing
contraints. That is, the device must perform a task before a deadline. Broadly
speaking, real-time devices are either soft or hard real-time depending on how
strict we need to be about meeting deadlines. In the following post, we will
focus almost exclusively on how to statically analyze hard real-time programs
to guarantee that timing requirements are always met.
