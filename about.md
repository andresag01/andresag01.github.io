# Hello!

My name is Andr√©s. I am a humble programmer interested in all things tech. I started this blog as a kind of 'journal' to keep track of interesting, amusing, exciting things I find on the job.

Feel free to get in touch if you would like to exchange ideas and discuss. I am always up for that!
